        # Airline delay causes
        The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) tracks the on-time performance of domestic flights operated by large air carriers. BTS began collecting details on the causes of flight delays in June 2003. Summary statistics and raw data are madeavailable to the public at the time the Air Travel Consumer Report is released, resulting in the following:

        The dataset consists of 1,247,486 different flights. Each flight consists of 30 columns. Due to the size of the data set, a stratified random sampling method was used to reduce this. The reduced dataset is used in this application to reduce loading time
